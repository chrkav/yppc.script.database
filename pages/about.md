## About the Collection

This collection consists of a catalog of the scripts collected by the Young People's Performing Company of Durham, North Carolina. Many of the scripts are unique, having been written by the founders of the theater or by other members of the community. 

## The History of the Young People's Performing Company

Young People’s Performing Company was established as a 501c3 non-profit in 1982 by Jeffryn and Ty Stephens, whose mission was to ensure that any young person who wanted it could have the experience of being on stage. Focusing on immersing young people from preschool through high school in the dramatic arts, YPPC staged over 1,000  productions over the course of its 42-year history.

YPPC has partnered with the Durham Arts Council since 1985, who generously provides the Company’s class, rehearsal, and performance space in the WTVD Theater and the Jeffryn Stephens Stage. With the generous support of donors and grants from the Durham Arts Council and North Carolina Arts Council, YPPC stages at  least two musicals and more than 20 productions annually.

YPPC historically offered classes in theater, playwriting, improv, tech, and other aspects of the performing arts. Many alumni go on to audition for college and university theater programs and conservatories, and numerous alumni have become accomplished theater professionals, pursuing careers as writers,  directors, actors, and skilled technicians.

The mission of YPPC continues under the artistic direction of Jessica Sabatini, an alumnus of the company, who was appointed by the Board of Directors in 2023.
